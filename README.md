[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/youngkin/mockvideo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/youngkin/mockvideo) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/youngkin/mockvideo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/youngkin/mockvideo)

This project is related to the blog series [Developing & Deploying Kubernetes Applications on a Raspberry Pi Cluster](https://medium.com/better-programming/develop-and-deploy-kubernetes-applications-on-a-raspberry-pi-cluster-fbd4d97a904c). Unlike the focus of that blog series, this application isn't meant to be deployed exclusively on a Raspberry Pi cluster. Rather, its intent is to showcase microservice development best practices with a relatively simple, but production-ready, application. The application is written in Go.

# Overview

MockVideo, as its name implies, provides a mockup of a fictional cable TV company or [MSO (Multiple System Operator)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26084/multiple-system-operators-mso). Today most of these companies are evolving beyond simply providing TV service. Several provide not only TV service, but also Internet access and wireless telephony service. The intial focus of this will be on the video delivery aspects of a fictional MSO.

Currently, the following capabilities have been implemented:

1. Use of [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
2. Creating Docker images
3. Helm deployments to a Kubernetes cluster
4. Implementation of an Account microservice. Currently the implemention supports the ability to perform CRUD operations on users associated with any account from a MySQL database. The primary purpose of this initial capability is to demonstrate:

    1.  Application (Go) [package design](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/02/package-oriented-design.html)  as promoted by Bill Kennedy at [Arden Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com).
    2.  Application configuration
    3.  Logging
    4.  Database (MySQL) access
    5.  Unit testing, including HTTP server testing
    6.  Use of Helm/Kubernetes including:

        1. Helm deployments and upgrades
        2. Kubernetes Ingress
        3. Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps
        4. Kubernetes volumes
    7.  Metrics publishing via Prometheus with associated Grafana dashboard(s)
    8.  CI/CD via Jenkins, this includes deploying building a local Docker image. If testing is successful then the docker image will be tagged and pushed to Docker Hub, the application will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and the current git commit will be tagged with the docker image's tag. 
    9. Best practices for all of the above.

The primary code for the Account service is located at [cmd/accountd](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/src/cmd/accountd) with some supporting code in the [internal package](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/src/internal), [helm](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/infrastructure/helm), [kubernetes](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/infrastructure/kubernetes), [sql](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/infrastructure/sql), and [Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/youngkin/mockvideo/tree/master/infrastructure/dashboards) locations.

The next phase will focus on the initial development of a second microservice. The purpose of this will be to demonstrate the use of common code and to also demonstrate the use of Helm in a second microservice. These two goals will validate the package design and the ability to continue to develop and deploy multiple microservices on independent schedules. I'll also be working on finding, or developing, an integration test capability in Go.

Beyond this, other candidate features include:

1. Full support for user accounts including what services they've subscribed to.
2. Support for obtaining program guide information
3. Support for recordings, including scheduling recordings (from the program guide) and querying scheduled recordings.

There is no intent to provide access to any video, video recording, or playback of video recording. Implementing these types of features is beyond the scope of this effort and would interfere with the stated purpose of creating a "template" application that demonstrates best-practices of microservice applications deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

This README will be regularly updated as progress continues. I welcome contributions, PRs, Issues, and comments.

# API

## Representation

A User is represented in JSON as follows:

```
{
accountid: {int}        //  The identifier of the user's account
  href: {string}        //  Resource URL, e.g., /users/1. Returned on GET. Don't populate for POST/PUT
  id: {int}             //  Resource identifier, don't populate on POST
  name: {string}        //  The user's name
  email: {string}       //  The user's email address
  role: {int}           //  The user's role relative to the account. They can be the owner (0), admin 
                            capabilities (1), or restricted (2)
  password: {string}    //  This field is provided on POST or PUT. It will never be returned by a GET request.
}
```

Example:

``` JSON
{
  "accountid": 42,
  "href": "/users/42",
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Mickey Dolenz",
  "email": "mdolenz@themonkees.com",
  "role": 0,
  "password": "heyheywerethemonkees"
}
```

The JSON representation for a set of Users is:

``` 
{
  "Users": [
    {
      accountid: {int}
      href: {string}
      id: {int}
      name: {string}
      email: {string}
      role: {int}
      password: {string}
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Example:

```
{
  "Users": [
    {
       "accountid": 42,
       "href": "/users/42",
       "id": 101,
       "name": "Mickey Dolenz",
       "email": "mdolenz@themonkees.com",
       "role": 0,
        "password": "heyheywerethemonkees"
    },
    {
       "accountid": 42,
       "href": "/users/52",
       "id": 105,
       "name": "Cass Elliot",
       "email": "cass@mama.com",
       "role": 1,
        "password": "mondaymonday"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

|429|Server busy, can retry after `Retry-After` time has expired (in seconds)|
|500|Internal server error, can retry, subsequent request _might_ succeed|

# Runnning and testing the application

This section covers how to run the application as a standalone executable, a Docker container, and in a Kubernetes cluster. 

## Prerequisites

A Go development environment must be installed. See the [Go installation page](https://golang.org/doc/install) for details.

A MySQL database is required. It can either be run in a Docker container or from the command line as a standalone service (e.g., installed via Homebrew and started with `brew services start mysql`). The examples below assume it's run directly from the command line. The username and password are assumed to be admin/admin. These, and other configuration variables, can be changed as described in the sections below on Helm Secrets and running the application locally (`Running the application/ Local execution`).

The `accountd` executable will need to be built as well. For local execution:  
```
cd <projectroot>/src/cmd/accountd`
go build
```

To build a docker executable run:
```
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build
```

This wil build an executable that will run in Minikube, Docker Desktop (Mac), and on a Raspberry Pi. You may need to tweak this command, and possibly the Dockerfile, to get an image appropriate for your deployment environment.

To build a Docker image, after building the docker executable above, from the same directory above run `docker build -t local/accountd .`. `local` can be anything. I chose `local` to differentiate it from my Docker Hub image. Likewise `accountd` can be anything, but this is the name of the executable so it seems reasonable. I chose not to tag the image relying instead on `latest` since I don't plan on keeping around several versions of this local image.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [Helm Secrets](https://github.com/zendesk/helm-secrets) are required to install to Kubernetes. [Helm secrets â€“ a missing piece in Kubernetes](https://lab.getbase.com/helm-secrets-a-missing-piece-in-kubernetes/) is a good starting point for learning how to use Helm Secrets.

Regarding secrets, if you want to override or even view the MySQL user and password you'll likely need to recreate the `<path-to-project>/src/cmd/accountd/helm/accountd/secrets.values.yaml` file. It's encrypted with my OpenPGP password and is (hopefully!) inaccessible. Prior to encryption with Helm Secrets the file looks like this:

``` YAML
secrets:
    dbuser: admin
    dbpassword: admin
```

For Kubernetes, a namespace called `video` will need to be created - `kubectl create ns video`. 

## Pre-commit check

This check is handy when making changes to ensure there is no obvious breakage from the changes.

From the project root directory (`mockvideo`) run:

``` 
./precheck
```

This runs `go vet ./...`, `go fmt ./...`, `golint ./...`, and `go test -race ./...`

## Running the application

### Local execution

`./accountd -configFile "/Users/rich_youngkin/Software/repos/mockvideo/src/cmd/accountd/testdata/config/config" -secretsDir "/Users/rich_youngkin/Software/repos/mockvideo/src/cmd/accountd/testdata/secrets"`

Per the configuration, the application will listen on port 5000. This, as well as the MySQL location, username, and password can all be configured using configuration and secrets files referred to by the `-configFile` and `-secretsDir` flags in the command line.

### Run in a Docker container

[This link provides a good overview of the Docker `run` command](https://rollout.io/blog/the-basics-of-the-docker-run-command/).

`docker run -d   -p 5001:5000 -v <path-to-project>/mockvideo/src/cmd/accountd/testdata:/opt/mockvideo/accountd local/accountd:latest`

`-p 5001:5000` forwards local port 5001 to the application listening port 5000. `-v ...` provides the file system mapping for the container to the local project directory containing the configuration and secrets files.

`docker stop <container-id>` will halt the docker container hosting the application.

### Run in Kubernetes

The commands listed here are all run from `<path-to-project>/mockvideo/src/cmd/accountd`.

To install the application:

``` 
helm secrets install --namespace video --name accountd helm/accountd --values helm/accountd/secrets.values.yaml --debug
```

To upgrade the application (after the initial installation):

```
helm secrets upgrade  --values helm/accountd/secrets.values.yaml accountd helm/accountd --debug
```

## Testing the application

As mentioned above, there is a "pre-commit check", `precheck`, that can be run from the command line at the project root that will run unit tests and things like `go vet`. There is also a shell script at the project root called `smoketest.sh`. This will setup the MySQL database and run various `curl` commands to exercise the application. This file can also serve as a good example if you want to run your own `curl` commands. Run the following to get a usage message:

```
./smoketest.sh help 
usage:
    smoketest <dbaddr> <dbport> <svcaddr>
Example:
    smoketest localhost 3306 accountd.kube
```

The above example assumes a Kubernetes deployment with an Ingress controller configured as described in [How to Install Kubernetes Ingress on a Raspberry Pi Cluster](https://medium.com/better-programming/install-kubernetes-ingress-on-a-raspberry-pi-cluster-e8d5086c5009). `accountd.kube` is the host name defined by the application's ingress specification in Kubernetes. This assumes a working Kubernetes cluster. It doesn't matter if this cluster is on a Raspberry Pi or not.

Running smoketest against a locally executing application could be done by running `./smoketest.sh localhost 3306 localhost:5000`. To run against an application running in a Docker container you could run `./smoketest.sh localhost 3306 localhost:5001`. This assumes that MySQL is setup as described above and that the application is run from the command line or via `docker` as described above.
